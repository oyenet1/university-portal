                                I understand that Binters Integrations has a juicy compensation plan. Please explain.

                                rewards from your purchases, you earn additional rewards from the purchases of your
                                downlines,
                                to
                                the fifth generation. And what’s more, you are at liberty to have an unlimited number of
                                downlines.

                            <li>
                                Is it compulsory that I build my network, or that I refer someone before I can earn from
                                Binters
                                Integrations?
                                No. Referral is optional. Even if you have not built your network, you will still earn from
                                your
                                own
                                purchases.

                            <li>
                                Why then do I need to refer anyone to join my network?
                                The advantage of referring others to join your network is to enable you earn commission from
                                what
                                your downlines have purchased. With your unlimited number of downlines you earn commission
                                from
                                Binters Integrations even if you make no purchases.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So it is advisable to make purchases while building your network…
                                Yes, we encourage you to purchase all your items from Binters Integrations so you can earn
                                commission from your own purchases. We encourage you as well to build your network so you
                                can
                                earn
                                from all the purchases of your downlines.
                                How can I use the credit reward that Binters Integrations offers me?

                                activities.

                                I am curious. Why did Binters Integrations adopt the network approach?
                                There is no life without a network. A family is a network. A workplace is a network. A
                                church is
                                a
                                network. And a marketplace is naturally a network. It is easier to accumulate wealth through
                                a
                                network than through individual efforts. As it is said, it is better to earn 1% of the
                                efforts
                                of
                                100 people than earn 100% of the efforts of 1 person. The system is designed with daily
                                shoppers
                                in
                                mind. Whether you have a lot of money to shop with or you shop on a budget, we accommodate
                                you.
                                This
                                is why the network approach is open but not compulsory. Through the network, you earn at two
                                levels:
                                through your shopping activities and through the shopping activities of all your referrals
                                within
                                your network, down to the fifth generation. The larger your network within five generations,
                                the
                                higher your earnings from Binters Integrations, and we pay you promptly.
