                            30.7.2 Binters cannot divide a Downline Organisation, nor can it split commission or bonus
                            cheques
                            between the joint owners.
                            30.7.3 If a jointly owned Associateship is dissolved, the individual(s) who relinquished
                            ownership
                            in the original Associateship may apply as new Associates under any Sponsor but may not
                            purchase or
                            join an existing Associateship.
                            30.8 Succession: If an Associate dies or becomes incapacitated, his/her rights to
                            commissions,

                            his/her
                            nominated next of kin. Upon death or incapacitation, the next of kin must present Binters
                            with proof
                            of death or incapacitation, then fill in required form for transfer of account. You may
                            inherit and
                            retain another Associateship even though you currently own or operate an Associateship. A
                            non-Associate who acquires an Associateship through succession or holds other accounts must
                            meet
                            annual requirements to maintain the accounts.

                        <li> Taxes
                            Binters Associates must comply with all relevant taxation legislation. Associates should
                            seek
                            professional advice from their own accountant or tax advisor as to how to keep proper
                            business
                            records and accounts, remaining tax-compliant. Binters bonus may be subject to taxation,
                            depending
                            on the country, and so must be properly accounted for in annual tax returns. Associates

                            their Binters business in a business-like manner may also be entitled to deduct certain
                            expenses
                            incurred in earning their Binters bonus. Such expenses should be properly recorded and
                            evidenced
                            with receipts.

                        <li> Telephone and E-Mail Solicitation
                            The use of any automated telephone solicitation equipment in connection with the promotion
                            of
                            Binters opportunity is strictly prohibited. The use of “boiler-room” telemarketing
                            operations for
                            promotion over the telephone, or to recruit Associates, is strictly prohibited. Associates
                            are also
                            forbidden from sending unsolicited e-mail messages or “spamming” to promote the opportunity
                            or
                            recruit Associates. Associates should also make themselves familiar with relevant privacy
                            legislation.

                        </li>
                        <li> Countries and Territories
                            There are no exclusive countries or territories for promoting Binters opportunity, nor shall
                            any
                            Associate imply or state that he/she has an exclusive territory to promote Binters.

                        <li> Transfer of Sponsorship
                            34.1 Conflicting Enrolments: Every prospective Associate has the ultimate right to choose
                            his/her
                            own Sponsor. As a general rule, the first Associate who does meaningful work with a
                            prospective
                            Associate is considered to have first claim to sponsorship. Basic tenets of common sense and
                            consideration should govern any dispute that may arise. In the event that a prospective
                            Associate or
                            any Associate on behalf of a prospective Associate, submits more than one Associate
                            Application and
                            Agreement to Binters, listing a different Sponsor on each, the Company will only consider
                            valid the
                            first Associate Application and Agreement that it receives, accepts, and processes. If there
                            is any
                            question concerning the sponsorship of an Associate, the final decision will be made by
                            Binters.
                            34.2 Cross-line Raiding: Binters will not permit any change in the line of sponsorship
                            except in the
                            following circumstances:
                            34.2.1 Where an Associate has been fraudulently or unethically induced into joining Binters
                            whereby
                            monetary transactions have occurred.
                            34.2.2 Where an incorrect placement was made due to an Associate error, a change in the
                            placement
                            can be made to correct the error where a request for a change is made if there are no
                            bonuses
                            already accumulated in the account. If you make such a request, you must also submit the
                            written
                            consent of your Sponsor and that person’s Sponsor along with the required placement change
                            fee. If
                            at the time of the request you have any downline organization in place, no change will be
                            permitted
                            in the line of sponsorship. In the event that such a change is approved, commissions and
                            bonuses
                            earned will be adjusted accordingly. In no case will a change of placement be approved where
                            a
                            signed application has not been received by Binters.
                            34.2.3 If you terminate your Associateship in writing you may rejoin under the Sponsor of
                            your
                            choice after a period of one (1) month. In the event you terminate your Associateship, you
                            forfeit
                            all rights, bonuses, and commissions under your previous account. You may not avoid
                            compliance with
                            this policy through the use of assumed names, corporations, partnerships, trusts, spouse
                            names,
                            fictitious ID numbers, etc.
                            34.2.4 If you have been “inactive” (i.e., no purchases or participation in any other form as
                            an
                            Associate) for a period of six (6) successive months, you may terminate your Policies &
                            Procedures,
                            Terms and Conditions of Contract, Associateship in writing and rejoin immediately under the
                            Sponsor
                            of your choice.
                            34.3 Cross-line raiding is strictly prohibited. "Cross-line raiding" is defined as the
                            enrolment or
                            attempted enrolment of an individual or Entity that already has an account with Binters
                            within the
                            preceding twelve (12) calendar months within a different line of sponsorship. The use of
                            trade
                            names, assumed names, corporations, partnerships, trusts, spouse names, fictitious ID
                            numbers or any
                            other vehicle to circumvent this policy is prohibited. Associates may not demean, discredit,
                            or
                            invalidate other Binters Associates in an attempt to entice another Associate to become part
                            of the
                            first Associate’s Downline Organisation.

                        <li> Responsibilities of Associates and Sponsors
                            35.1 Ongoing Supervision, Training, and Sales: Any Associate who sponsors another Associate
                            into
                            Binters must train the new Associate on the Compensation Plan, Policies and Procedures.
                            Associates
                            must also supervise and monitor Associates in their Downline Organisation to ensure they
                            conduct
                            business professionally and ethically, promote sales properly, and provide quality customer
                            service.
                            As an Associate progresses through the various levels of leadership, his/her
                            responsibilities to
                            train and motivate downline Associates will increase.
                            35.2 Non-disparagement: In setting the proper example for their downline, Associates must
                            not
                            disparage other Binters Associates, the Compensation Plan, or the Company’s employees. Such
                            disparagement constitutes a material breach of these Policies and Procedures.
                            35.3 Holding Applications or Orders: All Associates must forward to Binters any forms and
                            applications they receive from other Associates or applicant Associates, within three (3)
                            business
                            days after which the forms or applications are signed. Holding of applications or orders is
                            strictly
                            prohibited in Binters Authorized Centers, Representative and Authorized Mobile. Such actions
                            of
                            withholding by representatives of Binters will be penalized or fined 1,000 USD or 10% of
                            withholding
                            amount, whichever is higher if claims of withholding are found to be true.
                            35.4 Reporting Policy Violations: Associates should report any observed violations of a
                            policy
                            violation to Binters.

                            38.1 Disputes between Associates
                            38.1.1 Grievances and Complaints: When an Associate has a grievance or complaint with
                            another
                            Associate regarding any practice or conduct in relationship to their respective involvements
                            with
                            Binters, the complaining Associate should first discuss the problem with the other
                            Associate. If
                            this does not resolve the problem, the complaining Associate should report the problem to
                            his/her
                            upline. If the matter cannot be resolved, it must be reported in writing to Binters. The
                            company
                            will review the complaint and constitute a disputes resolution team who will help resolve
                            the issue.
                            The complaint should identify specific instances of alleged improper conduct and, to the
                            extent
                            possible, identify the relevant dates on which the event(s) complained of took place, the
                            location(s) where they occurred, and all persons who have firsthand knowledge of the
                            improper

                            38.1.2 Disputes Resolution Team: Upon receipt of a written complaint, the Binters Disputes
                            Resolution Team will investigate the matter, review the applicable policies, and advise on a
                            best
                            resolution in form of disciplinary measures, compensation or retribution.
                            38.2 Disputes between Binters and Associates
                            38.2.1 Mediation and Arbitration: All unresolved disputes and claims relating to Binters,
                            its
                            Compensation Plan, the rights and obligations of its Associates and Binters, or any other
                            claim or
                            cause of action relating to product purchase(s) or performance, either of an Associate or of
                            Binters
                            under the Associate Agreement, shall first be put before a mediator acceptable to both
                            parties for
                            resolution. Each party shall bear its own costs in the mediation. Should mediation fail to
                            resolve
                            the dispute then it shall be put before arbitration within the country in which the dispute
                            occurred. Each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for their own costs, including
                            legal
                            and filing fees. This agreement to mediate and, failing mediation, arbitrate, will survive
                            any
                            cancellation or expiration of the Associate Agreement. Nothing in these Policies and
                            Procedures
                            shall prevent Binters from applying to and obtaining from any court having jurisdiction a
                            writ of
                            attachment, temporary injunction, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or other
                            available
                            relief to safeguard and protect Binters’s interest prior to, during, or following the filing
                            of any
                            arbitration or other proceeding, or pending the rendering of a decision or award in
                            connection with
                            any arbitration or other proceeding. The existence of any Associate claim or cause of action
                            against
                            Binters does not preclude Binters from enforcing the Associate’s covenants and agreements
                            contained
                            in the Associate Agreement.

                            38.3 Disciplinary Actions: Violation of any of the terms and conditions of the Associate
                            Agreement,
                            or any illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical business conduct by an Associate, may
                            result, at
                            Binters’s discretion, in one or more of the following sanctions:

                            38.3.2 Probation, which may include requiring an Associate to take remedial action and will
                            include
                            follow-up monitoring by Binters to ensure compliance with the Agreement;
                            38.3.3 Withdrawal or denial of an award or recognition, or restricting participation in
                            Binters-sponsored events for a specified period of time or until the Associate satisfies

                            product order, participating in Binters programs, progressing in the Compensation Plan, or
                            participating as a Sponsor (including participating as an International Sponsor), for a
                            specified
                            period of time or until the Associate satisfies certain specified conditions;
                            38.3.5 Withholding commissions or bonuses for a specified period of time or until the
                            Associate

                            incurred by Binters and as permitted by law; and/or

                            However,

                            for
                            subsequent purchase within one month.
                            39.5 Shipping Discrepancies and Damage Claims: Failure to notify Binters of any shipping

                            contact the Associate by telephone and/or mail to rectify errors and correct payment. If
                            these
                            attempts are unsuccessful after five (5) working days, the order will be returned
                            unprocessed and
                            all payments will be preserved in the member’s back office for future use by the member.

                            42.1 Inactivity: Associates who do not meet the requirements specified in the Binters
                            Compensation
                            Plan or whose accounts have been inactive, for six months will have their commissions and
                            bonuses
                            withheld until further purchases commence and will lose any accumulated compensation and
                            bonuses
                            generated through their Downline Organisation for the period of inactivity.
                            42.2 Involuntary Cancellation: An Associate’s violation of any of the terms of the Associate
                            Agreement, including any amendments which may be made by Binters in its sole Policies &
                            Procedures,
                            Terms and Conditions discretion from time to time, constitutes a material breach of the
                            Associate
                            Agreement and may result, at Binters’s option, in any of the Disciplinary Actions listed,
                            including
                            cancellation of his/her Associateship. Involuntary Cancellation of an Associateship will
                            result in
                            the Associate’s loss of all rights to his/her Downline Organisation and any bonuses and
                            commissions
                            generated thereby. An Associate whose Agreement is involuntarily cancelled shall receive
                            commissions
                            and bonuses only for the last full calendar week prior to termination. When an Associateship
                            is
                            involuntarily cancelled, the Associate will be notified by certified email at the address on
                            file
                            with the Company. Cancellation is effective on the date on which written notice is mailed
                            via
                            certified email, return receipt requested, to the Associate’s last known address or when the
                            Associate receives actual notice of cancellation, whichever occurs first. In the event of
                            such
                            Involuntary Cancellation, the Associate must immediately cease to represent himself/herself
                            as a
                            Binters Associate. The Associate may appeal the termination to Binters. The Associate’s
                            appeal must
                            be in writing and must be received by the company within fifteen (15) calendar days of the
                            date of
                            Binters cancellation letter. If Longrich does not receive the appeal within the fifteen-day
                            period,
                            the cancellation will be final. The Associate must submit all supporting documentation with
                            his/her
                            appeal correspondence. The written appeal will be reviewed by the company. If the Associate
                            files a
                            timely appeal of termination, the company will review and reconsider the termination,
                            consider any
                            other appropriate action, and notify the Associate in writing of its decision. This decision
                            of the
                            company will be final. An Associate whose Associate Agreement is involuntarily cancelled may
                            reapply
                            to become an Associate twelve (12) calendar months from the date of cancellation. Any such
                            Associate
                            wishing to reapply must submit a letter to Binters setting forth the reasons why he/she
                            believes the
                            company should allow him or her to operate an Associateship. It is within Binters’s sole
                            discretion
                            whether to permit such an individual to again operate with Binters.
                            42.3 Written Cancellation: An Associate may cancel his/her Agreement with Binters at any
                            time and
                            for any reason by providing written notice to the company indicating his/her intent to
                            discontinue
                            his/her Associateship status. The written notice must include the Associate’s signature,
                            printed
                            name, address, and appropriate identification number.
                            42.4 Effect of Cancellation: Following an Associate’s voluntary or involuntary cancellation,
                            such
                            former Associate shall have no right, title, claim, or interest to the Downline Organisation
